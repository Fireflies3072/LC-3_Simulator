# LC-3_Simulator



LC-3 is an assembly language for education. It is not used in actual development. This is an LC-3 simulator for running LC-3 files. The project is still under development. Currently there are very limited functions. Later I will add more functions and work on the interface. Please post on Github if you find any problems.
